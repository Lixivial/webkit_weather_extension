# Weather.safariextz

### Support

You may email me at jesse.m.pearson _at_ gmail.com, or using [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Lixivial). There is an issue tracker available on this github repo.

### Requirements

1. Safari 5, Chrome 4 (not yet available)

### Source Code Usage

To use the weather.com source with this tree, you must provide a weather.com license key and partner ID by
signing up for weather.com's API yourself. Update Settings.plist with your information to allow weather.com 
to actually work. Wunderground is the default choice, anyway.

### Installation

Simply download the .safariextz from here, or http://www.redonxi.com/extensions/weather/Weather.safariextz and
either double click it, or "Run" and tell Safari to "Install."

### Usage

When installed, a toolbar item will become available to place on Safari's toolbar using "View -> Customize Toolbar..."
and a contextual menu will be available to display more extended information. Clicking the contextual menu
will drive you to your chosen website in a new tab, so that you may view radar and forecast information.

When the toolbar button is placed on Safari's toolbar, it will be badged (the red circle on the button) with the current
temperature. The icon will also change state to best represent the current conditions. If you need textual representations of
these, you may mouse over the button, or right-click anywhere on a web page.

### Settings

Currently there are four settings:

1. Location code   -- the code of your present location (international requires wunderground; this then is the airport code).
2. Site            -- which site to pull information from, this will have bearing in future releases. Currently the only real bearing it has is for international use.
3. Refresh rate    -- the rate at which information is updated. If set to manual, clicking the toolbar button or right clicking a web page will be the only way to get present information.
4. Unit of measure -- the unit in which to present temperatures.

### Planned features

1. Determining the zip code from Safari and Chrome's built in geolocation features (when allowed)
2. Allowing configuration of the tooltip and contextual menu information from a set of known fields
3. Allowing options to display radar and/or forecast information in the contextual menu.
4. More icons to better demonstrate more varied weather conditions
5. Weather alerts to replace the temperature badge.
6. Better international support and more sources.
